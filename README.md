# XShop

- This is first website page I ever made, my first interaction with web development. Because of that, the code is a little bit messy and unorganized.
- Over the last period I reviewed the project and I only added some JavaScript functionalities and improve responsive/navbar.

I used:

HTML, JS, a combination of CSS and SASS (by working on this project I found about SASS), little bit of Jquery and gulp.
