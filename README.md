# XShop

- This is the first website page I ever created, my first interaction with web development. Because of that, the code is a little bit messy and unorganized.
- Over the last period I reviewed the project and I only improved responsive/navbar and added some JavaScript functionalities like add to cart/ wishlist and filter for popular items on search button.

I used:
HTML, JS, a combination of CSS and SASS (by working on this project I found about SASS), a little bit of Jquery, gulp and Bootstrap.
